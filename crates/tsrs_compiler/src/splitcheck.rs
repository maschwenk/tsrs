// tsrs-only (notes/perf-next-heavy-files.md): checking one heavy declaration file on several checkers.
//
// Stealing moves whole files, so with many checkers the type-check pass cannot end before its costliest file does. In
// Next.js's `packages/next` that file is a checked declaration file: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`'s `types.d.ts`
// (249k nodes of inferred Zod types), a fifth of a one-checker check, alone on its checker for the whole pass at 32
// checkers. Its cost is TypeScript's: each `z.ZodObject<{ ... }>` reference relates a fresh type literal to the
// `ZodRawShape` constraint, comparing every Zod schema class in it to `ZodTypeAny` member by member (tsgo takes twice
// as long on it, with the same type and instantiation counts).
//
// So the type-check pass with stealing cuts such a file into contiguous statement ranges ("pieces"). The checker that
// runs the file's own queue item (the owner) checks the first piece; each other piece is a queue item of its own, at
// the front of another checker's queue, and that checker runs `Checker::check_source_file_piece` on it: the statements
// of the range and the nodes they deferred, nothing file-level. A piece nobody has started when the owner is done
// with its own is run by the owner. The owner then waits for the pieces in flight (they never wait on anything, so
// this cannot deadlock), adds their diagnostics to its collection (`add_piece_diagnostics`) and runs the normal
// per-file step, whose `check_source_file` does the file-level checks (grammar, deferred nodes, module exports) and
// skips the statements. The file's checker for later passes stays the owner.
//
// Why the output is the same: a file's diagnostics are its checker's collection for the file, deduplicated and sorted
// (`DiagnosticsCollection`). Output already does not depend on which checker checks a file or in what order a checker
// visits files (notes/perf-order-independence.md, the `random:<seed>` check): the diagnostics found for a node are a
// function of the program, not of what the checker resolved before. A piece is the same thing at statement
// granularity, a checker visiting some statements of a file without the others. Only declaration files are split:
// they have no function bodies, so no control flow, no unreachable-code or unused-identifier checks, and nothing
// later passes need from the checker that checked them (they are not emitted, and have no declaration diagnostics).
// Default library files are split only when they weigh most of a share (`LIB_MIN_SHARE_PERCENT`, `plan_splits`): at half a
// share (webpack at 16 checkers) splitting lib.dom.d.ts cost 3-4% of wall time, at a whole share (webpack and
// next-packages-next at 32) not splitting it made it the pass's tail.
//
// `TSRS_SPLIT_FILES` (read once): unset = on in the stealing pass; `0`/`off`; a comma list of `shadow` (the pieces run
// as usual, then the owner also checks the other checkers' pieces itself and reports the file as one checker finds
// it; it panics if the split would have reported something else, see `shadow_compare`) and `force:<k>`
// (split every checked declaration file with at least two statements into up to k pieces, whatever its weight: the
// test mode for the conformance suite and corpora) and `stats` (one line per pass on stderr: files split, pieces, pieces
// another checker ran; `stats:<file>` appends it to the file, for harnesses that keep stderr).

// A declaration file is split when its static weight (node count, text, imports) is at least 40% of an average
// checker's share of the pass, into pieces of about 1/PIECE_DIVISOR of a share. The weight underestimates declaration
// files like the MCP one about fourfold (5.4% of next's weight, 23% of its one-checker check CPU), so a file that
// weighs under half a share can still be the pass's tail: at 8 checkers the MCP file is 43% of a share and takes the
// whole check phase. Lighter declaration files cost about their weight (lib.dom.d.ts: 2.7% of the weight, 3% of the
// CPU), and splitting them only adds work: each piece costs the checker that runs it the library types it touches. On
// the 64-vCPU runner, 40% against 75%: next 0.294 against 0.398 s of check time at 8 checkers, 0.173 against 0.187 at
// 16, the same at 32 and 64; webpack (which splits lib.dom.d.ts) the same check time with 1-4% more instructions.
// Pieces of 1/8 of a share bring the MCP file's largest piece from 0.17 to 0.085 s at 16 checkers on a Mac (1/16 does
