//! tsrs-only: per-file regions in the CLI's `--noEmit` check, and freeing the tree and binder output of a checked
//! "leaf" file as soon as its checker is done with it (notes/mem-free-leaf-files.md, after Bun's `free_tree`).
//!
//! When the CLI turns file regions on (`enable`, before it creates the program), the host parses each TypeScript
//! source file (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`; not declaration files) that is loaded as a root file of the program and
//! whose path predicts a leaf (`PREDICTED_LEAF_PATTERNS`: tests, specs, stories, mocks) into a scratch region of its
//! own, and the file is bound in that region too (`bind`). Every other file is parsed into the thread arena as before,
//! where the large chunks are huge pages on Linux. The text, the `SourceFile` itself and the diagnostics stay outside
//! the region (the parser and the diagnostics escape the scratch region), so a freed file still has what the report
//! reads: name, text, line map, counters, and its diagnostics, collected before the free.
//!
//! A program created with `ProgramOptions::leaf_files` set marks its leaves right before its type-check pass
//! (`classify`, `SourceFile::is_check_leaf`): type-checked TypeScript modules that no other file refers to and that
//! declare nothing another file can reach. Only a file with a region can be one: a predicted file that is not a leaf
//! keeps its region, a leaf that was not predicted is not freed. After a leaf's semantic diagnostics are collected (the
//! pass's callback), `free` drops its region with `Region::retire_on_free`: its pages go back to the system and its
//! address range is never reused. Every other region lives for the rest of the process, as the thread arenas did.
