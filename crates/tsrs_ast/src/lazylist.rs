//! tsrs-only: member lists of unchecked declaration files parsed and bound on first use
//! (notes/mem-lazy-dts-members.md).
//!
//! In a CLI run where no declaration file is type-checked (`skipLibCheck` or `noCheck`), the parser parses the member
//! list of an interface, class or type literal in a declaration file as usual, and if the list is plain (no
//! diagnostic, no eager JSDoc, no comment directive, nothing whose binding reaches outside the list, and the arena can
//! discard what the list allocated: `tsrs_parser`'s `parse_member_list_lazily`), it throws the nodes away and keeps a
//! `LazyNodeList` instead: the owner node, where the list starts and the parser context there. The owner's `NodeList`
//! points at the record (a long-form `ThinSlice` whose slice is `LAZY_HEAD_DATA`). The binder skips the list and
//! records its own state at that point (`LazyBindContext`) on the record and on the owner's symbol
//! (`Symbol::set_lazy_list`). The first reader of the list's nodes (`NodeList::nodes`) or of the owner symbol's
//! `members` (or, for a class, `exports`) parses the list again from the recorded position (the parser hook) and binds
//! it with the recorded binder state (the binder hook) on its own thread, then publishes the nodes; every later reader
//! gets the same slice. A declaration that merges into the owner symbol in the same file and fills one of the tables
//! the list fills forces the list while the file is bound, so tables get their entries in source order (`tsrs_binder`
//! `force_pending_lazy_list`).
//!
//! States: `PENDING` (parsed lazily, the binder has not reached it: readers see no members, which only the parser
//! and the binder of the file can observe), `DEFERRED` (the binder skipped it: the next reader parses and binds it),
//! `UNBOUND` (the file was bound without reaching it: the next reader only parses it), `FORCING` (a thread is parsing
//! and binding it: other threads wait, the forcing thread's own reads get the list being bound), `DONE`.
//!
//! Threading: the record's plain fields (`owner`, `bind`) are written by the file's parser and binder before the
//! program is shared; `nodes` is written once by the forcing thread before its Release store of `DONE`, and read by
//! other threads only after an Acquire load of `DONE`.
