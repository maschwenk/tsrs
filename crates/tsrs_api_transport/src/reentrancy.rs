// Re-entrancy policy for API handlers (see README "Re-entrancy" and INTEGRATION.md).
//
// A client filesystem callback may issue API requests while the server request that triggered the
// callback is still running. In sync (MessagePack) mode the nested request runs on the very thread that
// is blocked in `Caller::call`; in async (JSON-RPC) mode it runs on another thread. Either way, if the
// nested request blocks on a non-reentrant resource (session mutex, exclusive checker lease) held by a
// request that is waiting for the client, nothing can make progress: the pinned Go server hangs there.
// tsrs instead reports a deliberate error. Handlers do not need the transport's types for this: the
// connection publishes the current request context in a thread-local for the duration of a request.
//
// Ownership. Every request has a `RequestState`. A client call made on a thread that is serving a
// request is *attributed* to that request; a call made on any other thread (compiler worker threads
// reading files during a program build, which carry no request identity) is *unattributed*: the
// protocol does not say which request a callback belongs to, so attribution is only as good as the
// thread that makes the call. A waiter that knows the resource holder (`Holder`, recorded by
// `lock_for_request` and by `ContentionWait` users) treats the holder as possibly stuck on the client
// when the holder (or a request the holder itself waits for, transitively) has an attributed call in
// flight, or when any unattributed call is in flight (it might be the holder's). Otherwise the waiter
// waits like Go, however long the holder takes.
//
// When a possibly-stuck holder is found:
// - Sync: only one top-level request runs at a time, so the waiter is a nested request issued from a
//   callback: the conflict is certain and is reported immediately.
// - Async: the transport cannot know whether the pending callback issued this waiter, so it fails only
//   after the holder has been possibly-stuck for the whole grace period (`ConnOptions::
//   reentrancy_grace`, default 10 s), measured per acquisition. A real async re-entry deadlock ends with
//   the error after the grace period instead of hanging.
//
// Known divergence from pinned Go (async only, bounded): an unrelated waiter is rejected after the
// grace period if the holder itself waits on a client callback for longer than the grace period, or if
// an unattributed callback (any worker-thread file read on the connection) stays pending that long,
// because those cannot be told apart from a re-entry deadlock. Go waits forever in both cases.
