// Memory regions of the language server (docs/LSP.md "Memory plan for a long-lived server"; not in Go, where the GC
// frees a program version and everything only it refers to).
//
// A program version owns:
// - its own region: what `CreateProgram` allocated (the cloned file list and resolution data of a reused program,
//   or everything a full build allocated on the calling thread);
// - the base region: the full build's region, shared by every version cloned from it (`UpdateProgram` hands the
//   shared processed-file data and the symlink cache to the next version);
// - the regions of its source files (each parsed file version has one, see parsecache.rs);
// - through its checker pool, the checkers' regions.
//
// `programOwner` is held by every `Project` value that refers to the program (projects are cloned per snapshot and
// live as long as a snapshot or a language service refers to them), so it is dropped exactly when nothing can reach
// the program any more. Dropping it frees the checkers and their regions, the `Program` itself, then the regions.
