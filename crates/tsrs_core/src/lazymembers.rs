// Port of microsoft/TypeScript#64475 (lazy member tables of instantiated class/interface references) and #64526
// (lazy members of `{ [P in keyof T]: X }` mapped types). On by default; `--noLazyMembers` or `TSRS_LAZY_MEMBERS=0`
// turns it off, which restores the reference (tsgo) behavior exactly. See notes/lazy-members.md.
//
// Follow-up candidates (notes/mem-lazy.md) each have their own switch below. A candidate only takes effect when the
// master switch is on too, so `TSRS_LAZY_MEMBERS=0` stays reference-identical whatever the candidate switches say.
